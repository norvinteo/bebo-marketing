# Bebo Studio Marketing Website - Progress Log

## May 20, 2025

1. Updated splash screen layout:
   - Repositioned loading bar between logo and text with even spacing
   - Modified DOM structure to place the progress bar between logo and tagline

2. Updated hero section animation:
   - Modified hero section title to fade in as a complete unit rather than word by word
   - Added exclusion rule to splitTextAnimation to prevent individual word animations in hero title
   - Maintained consistent alignment throughout

3. Removed all physical location information:
   - Removed address from contact page "Visit Us" section
   - Removed map element from contact page
   - Removed address from footer sections across all pages (index.html, contact.html, about.html, services.html, work.html)
   - These changes reflect that Bebo Studio doesn't currently have a physical office

4. Prepared for GitHub repository:
   - Initialized Git repository locally
   - Created .gitignore file to exclude macOS system files and other unnecessary files
   - Created comprehensive README.md with project information
   - Committed all files to local Git repository
   - Configured Git user information

5. Created and pushed to GitHub repository:
   - Created new public repository at https://github.com/norvinteo/bebo-marketing
   - Added remote origin pointing to GitHub repository
   - Pushed all project files to GitHub
   - Set up main branch tracking

These changes will provide a cleaner, more cohesive visual experience on both the splash screen and hero section, and ensure accurate representation of Bebo Studio's current operations. The Git setup and GitHub repository configuration enable collaborative development, version control, and public access to the marketing website code.
